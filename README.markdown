Welcome!
========

This is simply a collection of random Java and Ruby files that try to demonstrate the ways to call and interact with JRuby via various scripting framework libraries (BSF, Java6 Scripting, etc.).  I'm doing this more as a learning process and exploratory project.  If you find any use in this, feel free to drop me a line.

Requirements:
-------------
The various class files need to make use of either Jakarta's Bean Scripting Framework, Java 6's Scripting API, and the jruby.jar, jruby-engine-1.1.3.jar.  To get some of these, see the links below:

   - JRuby Homepage: <http://jruby.codehaus.org/>
   - Java Scripting API: <http://scripting.dev.java.net>
   - Jakarta Bean Scripting Framework: <http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/>

Thanks; I welcome your comments/suggestions.

                            JRuby only.  Looks promising.
