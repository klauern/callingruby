Welcome!

This is simply a collection of random Java and Ruby files that try to demonstrate the ways to call and interact with JRuby via various scripting framework libraries (BSF, Java6 Scripting, etc.).  I'm doing this more as a learning process and exploratory project.  If you find any use in this, feel free to drop me a line.

Questions:

Thanks; I welcome your comments/suggestions.
